# reinforcement-tetris

Using reinforcement learning and Keras to learn to play Tetris

## Todo

- [ ] Add GUI to really visualize it playing Tetris
- [ ] Test on some other metrics besides number of deaths
- [ ] Add support for previous time steps (this seems like it could be tricky - could be done with persistent states in RNN layers maybe)
